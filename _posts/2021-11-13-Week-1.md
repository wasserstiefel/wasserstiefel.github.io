### Ex Nihilo

<p align="justify" style="padding-bottom:10px">
  Just to begin with the blog already, cause it has taken me more time than expected to actually start writing this, I think I'll explain
  what I would like to achieve with these weekly writings, to sort of make an explicit framework of the way this is going to work out and to be not completely
  lost in further posts. For starters, I'd like this to be a space in which I share with the few of you that will take the time to read this, some of my 
  study works, things that cross my mind or ideas that I have over the week, at the end, I do believe that knowledge by the sake of knowledge is futile and
  is its implementation the only way to make sense of it, in our time-limited existence on this earth.

 One of the texts that has impacted me the most about art creation, is one interview with russian filmmaker Andrei Tarkovski about the symbolic purpose of its creations,
 explaining, just as Albercht Durer did at its time similarly, that art has something -clearly more complex and less simplified as I'm writing it here- reminiscent as 
 how god -unparticularlly and conceptually speaking- created our existence and everything else <i>ex nihilo. </i>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="padding-bottom:10px">
  <i>Andrei Tarkovsky: Art is the capacity to create, it's the reflection, the mirror-image, of the Creator's gesture. We artists only repeat, only imitate that gesture. Art is one of those precious moments in which we resemble the Creator. That is why I have never believed in art which would be independent of the supreme Creator, I don't believe in art without God. The raison d'être of art is a prayer, it's my prayer. If this prayer, if my films can bring people to God, so much the better. My life would then take on its sense, the essential sense of "serving." But I would never impose it: to serve does not mean to conquer.

  Both Tarkosvki and Albercht Durer -who deserve in the future a more complete and detailed analysis of its <i>corpus-</i> are in some essential way not that far from the school of thought of irish philosopher Georges Berkeley, that describes human beings as a medium or vessels for god, and human senses being god's way of expression; puppeteering <i>phenomena</i> as a way to reveal itself to the human eye, thus why Berkeley as well, considered art as a profound and soul touching experience. In praxis, we can learn from the <i>quattrocento,</i> that idealism and maintaining the notion of "sublime" either as "god" or "perfection" -because they were used interchangeably at the time, given that the renaissance wasn't in fact godless- that to subject ourselves to a higher degree of idealism , we devote ourselves in reality, to a poetic notion of <i> artistic excellence</i> when it comes to creating something meaningful, as we no longer make art for conveying things as they are, but rather as how they could possibly be. </p>

<p align="justify" style="padding-bottom:10px">
  <i>Cultural heritage</i> and <i>intellectual heritage</i> serve to counterpart the dullness of the modern oversimplistic life. The <i>Renaissance</i> and the <i>Age of Enlightment</i> remain as monoliths of what is in my judge, the <i>zeitgeist</i> of how society should work like; a copernican revolution in favour of putting art, again, as the center of humanity, that's the unique way to solve today's purpose crisis, the catharsis that no government, no ideology and no economic system, can take away from us, a life-lasting scar in the membrane of the senses. </p>
  
  <p align="justify" style="padding-bottom:10px">
  What precisely is cultural and intellectual heritage? I believe that everyone should with upmost importancy , leave at its trace an important artwork, something that represents the metaphysical and the intangible of the being, that thing that has no sense in our rationality, a mere symbol, an abstraction of your being, what cannot be explained with words and what is able to extrapolate the solipsism and unique regard in which you're caged in, your <i> cultural heritage </i> to humanity. Then, there's no better way to make sense of the world than with words, language is the <i> alma mater </i> of everything that you experience in a daily basis, the <i> pontifex maximus </i> between your senses and your mind, that is why, writing a book of anything you are passionate about, becomes a must in a lifetime, our way to convey <i> intellectual heritage </i> and as a result, a more meaningful post-mortem existence.

  The study drawing was made in format <i> demi-raisin </i> which is 50 × 32,5 cm, freehand drawing using textbook proportions.
  </p>
  <p align="justify" style="padding-bottom:10px">
   The action of translating our field of vision to a paper requires a special attention to detail, something I have to admit I struggle with sometimes, despite of it, anatomic drawings are for me the most enjoyable of all types of drawing, because in contrast of displaying proportions as how <i> they look </i> -how landscapes and dead nature are drawn- anatomy relies in how proportions <i> should be like </i> because despite of the diviersified physiological traits that humans have, there are some things that remain consistent and that give shape to the visual idea of a <i> human. </i> Nowadays, self-proclaimed artists try to impregnate stylistically their work by deforming the geometry of the bodies and faces they draw, to portait uniqueness, while this is prefectly normal, directionless and intentionless tranfigurations can make an artwork seem as imprecise.
  
  
  <p align="justify" style="padding-bottom:10px">
    Matisse, Picasso, Shiele and many coetaneous artists were <i> a priori </i> excellent in drawing the world in a descriptive manner, is their efficient understanding of the academic principles what gave them the tool to modify their art to successfully generate deformations in a theoretical way. This, as good as it is for the mouvement, has provoked a misunderstanding in current days as people approach non-anatomical techniques in drawing, and justify it by alluding to a false idea of "abstraction" when they refer to "impression" or rather an incosistent aproach of it. Anatomic study drawing then, remains valuable as it is, but also works as the tool to approach more complex ideas and achieve succesfully intentional and visually correct deformations of the body. Proportion is "to make order from the chaos" said Le corbusier in architecture, and that's why I still value it very much; I believe it is not "art" on its own -the casual usage of the word "art" and "artist" is something I'll write about probably next week- but is surely is the path to art, so that's why I would like to master it, and just encourage in general, its use.

 <h3>Epilogue</h3>
  
  <p align="justify" style="padding-bottom:10px">
 I will try to make every saturday a post , however, i'll keep philosophy analysis limited to once every two weeks as it takes more time than just a causal explanatory blog about visual content. And for visuals, I'll choose weekly one photo or one drawing along anything that I've written so far. Thanks for reading.
