### Drawing from imagination

<p align="justify" style="padding-bottom:10px">
  As part of my search to find ways of better visual representation, and as people study the figure drawings of the 'Old Masters', its at is least, logical to analize as well the landscapes that some of the same artists have made throughout their landscaping career, not so far from urban sketching in terms of way of thinking and observing ; I believe engravings are in some sense the anatomical equivalent of the skeleton in our body, as both share this quality of being the internal framework in which both of them make sense proportionally and visually in its exterior, how flesh and skin **should** look like, and how a painting must be done based on its linework.

  This drawing here was just the result of studying superficially the kind of strokes used back then to represent nature.
