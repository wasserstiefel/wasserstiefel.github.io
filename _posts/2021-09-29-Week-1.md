### Ex Nihilo

<p align="justify" style="padding-bottom:10px">
  Just to begin with the blog already, cause it has taken me more time than expected to actually start writing this, I think I'll explain
  what I would like to achieve with these weekly writings, to sort of make an explicit framework of the way this is going to work out and to be not completely
  lost in further posts. For starters, I'd like this to be a space in which I share with the few of you that will take the time to read this, some of my 
  study works, things that cross my mind or ideas that I have over the week, at the end, I do believe that knowledge by the sake of knowledge is futile and
  is its implementation the only way to make sense of it, in our time-limited existence on this earth.

 One of the texts that has impacted me the most about art creation, is one interview with russian filmmaker Andrei Tarkovski about the symbolic purpose of its creations,
 explaining, just as Albercht Durer did at its time similarly, that art has something -clearly more complex and less simplified as I'm writing it here- reminiscent as 
 how god -unparticularlly and conceptually- created our realm of existence <i>ex nihilo. </i>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="padding-bottom:10px">
  <i>Andrei Tarkovsky: Art is the capacity to create, it's the reflection, the mirror-image, of the Creator's gesture. We artists only repeat, only imitate that gesture. Art is one of those precious moments in which we resemble the Creator. That is why I have never believed in art which would be independent of the supreme Creator, I don't believe in art without God. The raison d'être of art is a prayer, it's my prayer. If this prayer, if my films can bring people to God, so much the better. My life would then take on its sense, the essential sense of "serving." But I would never impose it: to serve does not mean to conquer.

  Both Tarkosvki and Albercht Durer -who deserve in the future a more complete and detailed analysis of its <i>corpus-</i> are in some essential way not that far from the school of thought of Irish philosopher Georges Berkeley, which takes this concept of god's implicit expression of its perfection through vessels, meaning, human beings as medium for god and art as its expression; and implies that our sense of "self" dissolves very subly with the sense of "god", making every phenomenal experience -everything that could be physically sensed- a will of god. By far, the most idealist of the empirists of its time, and in a positive manner, a way to subject ourselves to believe that we are -shedding any particular belief but rather limiting ourselves to the conceptually objective- capable of being able to produce an approach to perfection or something close to it, instances that could be described by the ancient meaning of "iconic" and thus, generate some sense of meaning in the things we put time to, which I believe, can only be done through art, altough the word "art" has been mutilated since the beginning of the last century, but that would be a topic I will expand on in 2 weeks approximately. </p.

Modern spanish philosophy describes the will of art and its necessity as one of the wills of <i>heritage</i> the way how modern society and how economic systems and political ideologies shape the way of how a purposeful life is concieved, how people's purpose is filled by its context, and what option there is but to submit, raises the question on humanity lost to the idea that living together is the way we find the most meaning, exactly where <i>biological heritage</i> comes in place, and in modern society, the way its current importance uniquely portraits everything around the topic of sexuality, it seems that people have lost their sense of personality and far worse, their sense of self, the idiotic -both modern and ethymological sense of the word- occurence of young people revolving their traits around what animalistic instinctive impulsions they have or etiher by mostly old conterpart, the uniquely single objective of reproducing and changing the gene pool and faithfully resigning any individual ambition.  </p>
