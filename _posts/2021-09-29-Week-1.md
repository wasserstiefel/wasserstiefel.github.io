### Ex Nihilo

<p align="justify" style="padding-bottom:10px">
  Just to begin with the blog already, cause it has taken me more time than expected to actually start writing this, I think I'll explain
  what I would like to achieve with these weekly writings, to sort of make an explicit framework of the way this is going to work out and to be not completely
  lost in further posts. For starters, I'd like this to be a space in which I share with the few of you that will take the time to read this, some of my 
  study works, things that cross my mind or ideas that I have over the week, at the end, I do believe that knowledge by the sake of knowledge is futile and
  is its implementation the only way to make sense of it, in our time-limited existence on this earth.

 One of the texts that has impacted me the most about art creation, is one interview with russian filmmaker Andrei Tarkovski about the symbolic purpose of its creations,
 explaining, just as Albercht Durer did at its time similarly, that art has something -clearly more complex and less simplified as I'm writing it here- reminiscent as 
 how god -unparticularlly and conceptually speaking- created our existence and everything else <i>ex nihilo. </i>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="padding-bottom:10px">
  <i>Andrei Tarkovsky: Art is the capacity to create, it's the reflection, the mirror-image, of the Creator's gesture. We artists only repeat, only imitate that gesture. Art is one of those precious moments in which we resemble the Creator. That is why I have never believed in art which would be independent of the supreme Creator, I don't believe in art without God. The raison d'être of art is a prayer, it's my prayer. If this prayer, if my films can bring people to God, so much the better. My life would then take on its sense, the essential sense of "serving." But I would never impose it: to serve does not mean to conquer.

  Both Tarkosvki and Albercht Durer -who deserve in the future a more complete and detailed analysis of its <i>corpus-</i> are in some essential way not that far from the school of thought of irish philosopher Georges Berkeley, that describes human beings as a medium or vessels for god, and human senses being god's way of expression; puppeteering <i>phenomena</i> as a way to reveal itself to the human eye, thus why Berkeley as well, considered art as a profound and soul touching experience. In praxis, we can learn from the <i>quattrocento,</i> that idealism and maintaining the notion of "sublime" either as "god" or "perfection" -because they were used interchangeably at the time, given that the renaissance wasn't in fact godless- that to subject ourselves to the ideals , is the answer to devote ourselves in reality, to a poetic notion of <i> artistic excellence</i> when it comes to creating something meaningful. </p>

<p align="justify" style="padding-bottom:10px">
  <i>Cultural heritage</i> and <i>intellectual heritage</i> serve to counterpart the dullness of the modern oversimplistic life. The <i>Renaissance</i> and the <i>Age of Enlightment</i> remain as monoliths of what is in my judge, the ideal status quo or zeitgeist of how society should work like; a copernican revolution in favour of putting art, again, as the center of humanity, that's the unique way to solve what i like to call "the purpose crisis", the catharsis that no government, no ideology and no economic system, can take away from us, a life-lasting scar in the membrane of the senses
