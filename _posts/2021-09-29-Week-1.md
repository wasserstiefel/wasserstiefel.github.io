### Drawing from imagination

<p align="justify" style="padding-bottom:10px">
  Just to begin with the blog already, cause it has taken me more time than expected to actually start writing this, I think I'll explain
  what I would like to achieve with these weekly writings, to sort of make an explicit framework of the way this is going to work out and to be not be completely
  lost in further posts. For starters, I'd like this to be a space in which I share with the few of you that will take the time to read this, some of my 
  study works, things that cross my mind or ideas that I have over the week, at the end, I do believe that knowledge by the sake of knowledge is futile and
  is its implementation the only way to make sense of it in our limited existence on this earth.

 One of the texts that has impacted me the most about art creation, is one interview with russian filmmaker Andrei Tarkovski about the symbolic purpose of its creations
 explaining, just as Albercht Durer did at its time similarly, that art has something -arguably less complex and simplified as I'm writing it here- reminiscent as 
 how god -as a concept- and the way it created our realm of existence <i>ex nihilo.</i>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="padding-bottom:10px">
  <i>Andrei Tarkovsky: Art is the capacity to create, it's the reflection, the mirror-image, of the Creator's gesture. We artists only repeat, only imitate that gesture. Art is one of those precious moments in which we resemble the Creator. That is why I have never believed in art which would be independent of the supreme Creator, I don't believe in art without God. The raison d'être of art is a prayer, it's my prayer. If this prayer, if my films can bring people to God, so much the better. My life would then take on its sense, the essential sense of "serving." But I would never impose it: to serve does not mean to conquer.
