# Simulacra

<p align="justify" style="padding-bottom:10px">
I think the most effective way to start writing these is to just write and make changes along the way, if not, I can stay a lot of time immobile thinking about what would be the best way to incorporate a certain topic I'd like to talk about,
however this time just explaining the thought of it gave already that little push to start gaining some "movement". Anyways, I present you this week just a couple of photos I took,
the process of taking them was really interesting, as I looked at that street one day prior, and just thought of myself what could possibly be behind that picturesque scene; I rumbled the thought 
all night, wondering what could be behind, the shadow that the trees produce is just for me very inviting, but rather than imagining bunch of backgrounds, I strangely had a very precise depiction of the place, and although 
it turned out to be completely different from what I was imagining, that reconstruction of space based out of nothing or with no clue in sight was a very ludic and revealing excercise.

As I said a week prior, this week will not have philosophy thought per se, but it does kind of take me to Johann Gottlieb Fichte's philosophy of how everything conceals their existence through
the human regard. Although this could rightfully be disagreed, most answers could be found in apophatic reasoning, delimiting things for what they are not, and then, being able to describe existence in a centrifugal manner.
This said, -as it is not coincidence that I write cetain names or certain words, I invite you to inmmerse yourself in them- doing the excercise of imagining the place behind a photo, doing the exact opposite, as imagining
what it could not possibly be, just helps describe a bit better the place in a logical way, and I think this could be a very useful tool for architects -for anything and anyone really, but because of the space reasoning in this particular instance-

And even after this, my reasoning was still illogical as I cannot divorce myself from some kind of bigger narrative, always injecting stories in things that have none, but within this imagined 
space, I just cannot get myself out the idea of when something incredibly sublime and truly metaphysical is going to develop upon me, very deep and cerebrally I wait patiently and formed this thought with certain requirements and conditions,
that someday, in the confine of my own, in peaceful silence, something inexplicable would gaze upon my way, to make its existence known, and disappear, leaving on its track something I would carry on but never be able to possibly express. Who says god is not
behind the landscape of that photo and we could not possibly get there because the image is frozen and we are not, who is there to say that there is no space beyond the little villages that appear in renaissance's portraits, 
faith is not constricted to religion but a way to see beyond of what we're able to do with these eyes, and thus, becomes a common word, everyone is faitful to the idea that tomorrow will wake up, that what you see is truth,
and that who you are, is you.
