<p id="introduction">
So, I have left a little bit on the side my weekly writings as I'm currently passing through some changes and preparations
to be able to change careers, it was a decision I analyzed and took consciously, as the carreer and the country are not longer
  I will, nonetheless continue making texts about the stuff I'm interested about, and architecture,
despite of the realisation that is not the thing I want to devote my time to completely, continues having a special place of interest
on the things that I find beautiful and transcendent in art.

I took part in an architecture photo competition in november of last year, the selected photos had the chance to be featured in the 295th
edition of the magazine. The prompt behind of the photos was representation of architecture school; I choose to represent not only what
it means to be an architecture student, but comprehend the modern context in which we live within, technological change is an unstoppable
force that will modify how the world works and the way we interact with it. Emphasizing the technological aspect of change, of studies,
and to capture a global reality, seemed logical to me as it is something that will stick to us from now on.
<br><br>
D'a (d'architectures) magazine is an architecture paris-based magazine that focus in architectural photography, museography, the economical and the aesthetical questions of today's
architectural ecosystem, I'm very  for the opportunity of taking part in their 295th edition of the magazine.
