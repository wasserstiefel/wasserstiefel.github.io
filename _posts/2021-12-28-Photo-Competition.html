So, I have left a little bit on the side my weekly writings as I'm currently passing through some changes and preparations to be able to change careers, I will, nonetheless
continue making texts about the stuff I'm interested about, and architecture, despite of the realisation that is not the thing I want to devote my time to completely, continues
having a special place of interest on the things that I find beautiful and transcendant in art.
