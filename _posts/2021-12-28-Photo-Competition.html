<p id="introduction">
So, I have left a little bit on the side my weekly writings as I'm currently passing through some changes and preparations to be able to change careers, I will, nonetheless
continue making texts about the stuff I'm interested about, and architecture, despite of the realisation that is not the thing I want to devote my time to completely, continues
having a special place of interest on the things that I find beautiful and transcendant in art.
<br><br>
I took part in a architecture photo competition in november of last year, winners were going to be featured in the next edition of the magazine, the prompt behind of the photos
was representation of architecture school, I choose to represent not only what it means to be an architecture student, but comprehend the context in which we live within,
technological change is an unstoppable force that will change the way the word works and how we interact to it, so for this reason I chose to emphasize the technological aspect of change.
<br><br>
D'a (d'architectures) magazine is an architecture paris-based magazine that focus in architectural photography, museography, the economical and the aesthetical questions of today's
architectural ecosystem, I'm very grateful for the opportunity of taking part in their 295th edition of the magazine.
