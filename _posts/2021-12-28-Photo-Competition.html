<p id="introduction">
So, I have left a little bit on the side my weekly writings as I'm currently passing through some changes and preparations
to be able to change careers, it was a decision I took as the carreer and the country I live within are not longer akin to
my long term objectives. I will nonetheless, continue making texts about the stuff I'm interested about, and architecture,
despite of the realisation that is not the thing I want to devote my time to, continues having a special place of interest
on the things that I find beautiful and transcendent in art.
<br><br>
I took part in an architecture photo competition in november of last year, the selected photos had the chance to be featured in the 295th
edition of a monthly architectural magazine. The prompt behind of the photos was representation of architecture school; I choose to represent not only what
it means to be an architecture student, but comprehend the modern context in which we live within, as technological change approaches us as an unstoppable
force that will modify how the world works and the way we interact with it. Emphasizing digitalization and to capture a current global reality,
seemed logical to me as it is something that will stick to us from now on.
<br><br>
D'a (d'architectures) magazine is an architecture paris-based magazine that focus in architectural photography, museography, the economical and aesthetical questions of today's
architectural ecosystem, I'm very pleased for the opportunity to take part in their 295th edition of the magazine and leave at with a high point, my connection
to architecture as a field of study, or at least temporarily.
